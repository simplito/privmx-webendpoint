# PrivMX Web Endpoint
PrivMX Web Endpoint is a JavaScript library designed to work in browser environment. It is used by applications and devices which are the ends of PrivMX secure communication channels. It encrypts and decrypts data, manages network connections and provides a functional API on the top of the WebAssembly build made of the native PrivMX Endpoint library written in C++. This allows applications to build their E2EE communication channels based on a few universal, client-side encrypted tools: Threads, Stores, and Inboxes.
